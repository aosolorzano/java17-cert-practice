 *
 * EXECUTOR-SERVICE METHODS:
 *
 * The first method "execute()" is inherited from the Executor interface, which the ExecutorService interface extends.
 * The "execute()" method takes a Runnable lambda expression or instance and completes the task asynchronously.
 *
 * public interface Runnable {
 *    void run();
 * }
 *
 * Unlike execute(), "submit()" returns a Future instance that can be used to determine whether the task is complete. It
 * can also be used to return a generic result object after the task has been completed.
