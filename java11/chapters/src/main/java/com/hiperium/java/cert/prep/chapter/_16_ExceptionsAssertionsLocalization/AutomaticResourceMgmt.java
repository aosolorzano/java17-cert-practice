/**
 * Inheriting Exception Classes:
 *
 * When evaluating catch blocks, the inheritance of the exception types can be important. For the exam, you should know
 * that NumberFormatException inherits from IllegalArgumentException. You should also know that FileNotFoundException
 * and NotSerializableException both inherit from IOException. This comes up often in multi‐catch expressions. For
 * example, why does the following not compile?
 *
 *      try {
 *          throw new IOException();
 *      } catch (IOException | FileNotFoundException e) {} // DOES NOT COMPILE
 *
 * Since FileNotFoundException is a subclass of IOException, listing both in a multi‐catch expression is redundant,
 * resulting in a compilation error.
 *
 * Ordering of exceptions in consecutive catch blocks matters too. Do you understand why the following does not compile?
 *
 *      try {
 *          throw new IOException();
 *      } catch (IOException e) {
 *      } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {} // DOES NOT COMPILE
 *
 * For the exam, remember that trying to catch a more specific exception (after already catching a broader exception)
 * results in unreachable code and a compiler error.

     * What happens if the try block also throws an exception? When multiple exceptions are thrown, all but the first
     * are called suppressed exceptions. The idea is that Java treats the first exception as the primary one and tacks
     * on any that come up while automatically closing.
     *
     * Try block throws the primary exception. At this point, the try clause ends, and Java automatically calls the
     * close() method. Catch block on JammedTurkeyCage class throws an IllegalStateException, which is added as a
     * suppressed exception. Then catch block in this method, catches the primary exception, and then prints the message
     * for the primary exception. Next, the code iterate through any suppressed exceptions and print them.
     *
     * Keep in mind that the catch block looks for matches on the primary exception. If we throw a RuntimeException,
     * then Java calls the close() method and adds a suppressed exception. The primary exception will be the RTE.
     * Since this does not match the catch clause in the next example, the exception is thrown to the caller.
