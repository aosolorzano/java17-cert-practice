/**
 * A denial of service (DoS) attack is when a hacker makes one or more requests with the intent of disrupting legitimate

 *
 * A denial of service attack comes from one machine. It may make many requests, but they have the same origin. By
 * contrast, a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a denial of service attack that comes from many sources at
