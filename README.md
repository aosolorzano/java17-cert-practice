### java17-cert-practice

This project is the implementation of some exercises or existing examples in the book "OCP Complete Study Guide" and the "OCP Practice Test" by Jeanne Boyarsky and Scott Selikoff for the OCP Certification exam.
This is an excellent material to prepare for the Java 11 certification, and I recommend it to you.

You can find more information about these books in the following pages:

* The [Complete Study Guide](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1119864585).
* The [Practice Tests](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119864615/).
